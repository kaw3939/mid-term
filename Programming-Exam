1.  Create a git repository on GitHUB titled <YOUR UCID>-IS683-MIDTERM
2.  Follow the instructions on GitHUB that are listed, so you can create a local repository on the Mywebclass server in your public_html directory
3.  Create a README file as the GitHUB directions indicate on mywebclass.org and follow the instructions to commit it HINT: COPY THE INSTRUCTIONS ON GITHUB SO YOU CAN USE THEM FOR LATER PARTS AND YOUR EXAM!

9.  You should use the KEY of the array as the class attribute value that is printed
